# pling
Plasmid analysis using rearrangement distances

Adding some ideas from conversation with Daria:

**pling dist**: given a list of plasmid fasta, will find distances between them all. User specifies alignment/annotation.

**pling cluster**: clusters plasmids based on (jaccard similarity and) DCJindel.
